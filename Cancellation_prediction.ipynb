    "2. **Key Observations**:\n",
    "- Short-term bookings (0-30 days) have the lowest cancellation rates (typically under 20%), likely because these are more urgent, planned trips\n",
    "- The 31-60 days range shows a moderate increase in cancellations, suggesting this is when some travelers start reconsidering their plans\n",
    "- Between 61-180 days, cancellation rates rise steadily, indicating that the longer the booking window, the more likely plans are to change\n",
    "- The 181-365 days range shows a significant jump in cancellations, possibly due to changing personal circumstances or finding better deals elsewhere\n",
    "- The >365 days category has the highest cancellation rate (over 50%), likely because plans made this far in advance are most susceptible to changes\n",

    "3 and 4 are insights on how this bar chart analysis can help with market research and hotel campaign restructuring\n",

    "3. **Business Implications**:\n",

    "- Early bookings might require larger deposits to reduce cancellations\n",

The importance of a feature is determined by how much the tree nodes, which use that feature, reduce impurity across all trees in the forest. The feature with the highest importance score contributes the most to the model's decision-making process. By understanding these feature importances, we can gain insights into which factors are most influential in predicting whether a hotel booking will be cancelled."
